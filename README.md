# ovenbird

Ovenbird is a small React app that shows the map of Melbourne and its suburb boundaries.

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) and [react-mapbox-gl](https://github.com/alex3165/react-mapbox-gl).

### Project

Ovenbird utilises the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) location platform to display the map of Melbourne, Australia and its suburb boundaries. The [Victoria suburb/locality boundaries](https://data.gov.au/dataset/vic-suburb-locality-boundaries-psma-administrative-boundaries) is sourced from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/) that provides access to public datasets from the Australian government.
